some thoughts/ ideas that i shared with my mentor, put here for
future reference. these points are not urgent or mentioned in the original plan

* should this program always be active/ daemon?
    * "activate" on ethernet cable?

* would we want further instructions i.e. "please plug in ethernet cable" 
    "no wifi" on the TV screen (apart from "here is the URL for the control panel")

* is the PI+TV assumed to be completely dedicated to running this program?
    * the original idea said, "when ethernet is plugged in, you can go, when
         it's not in [program is basically dormant]". 

* do we require the admin/user to ever have to connect with kb/mouse?
